## Installation
1. Download and extract the project files from the repository.
2. Place the extracted files in the `htdocs` directory (if using XAMPP) or the appropriate root directory for your web server.
3. Open your MySQL database management tool and create a new database.
4. Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) into the newly created database.
5. Configure the `config.php` file with the necessary database credentials.
6. Ensure your web server (Apache) and database server (MySQL) are running.
7. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/StudentManagementSystem/` to access the application.

## Admin Credentials
- **Username:** Avishkar
- **Password:** Admin@123

## Technologies Used
The Student Management System is developed using modern web technologies:
- **PHP** – Server-side scripting language for backend logic
- **MySQL** – Relational database management system for storing student data
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend technologies for a user-friendly interface
- **Bootstrap** – CSS framework for responsive and visually appealing UI
- **jQuery & AJAX** – Used for dynamic content loading and seamless user interactions
- **XAMPP/WAMP** – Recommended local development environments

## Configuration
To ensure proper functioning of the application, update the `config.php` file with the correct database connection details:
```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "studentmsdb";
```
Ensure that the database credentials match those of your MySQL setup. If using an online server, replace `localhost` with your server's hostname.

## Usage
1. Launch the application in your web browser.
2. Use the provided admin credentials or create a new administrator account.
3. Navigate through the dashboard to manage students, view detailed reports, and update records.
4. Add new students, modify existing records, and track attendance and grades.
5. Utilize the search feature to find student records instantly.
6. Generate reports on student performance, attendance, and other key metrics.

## Security Measures
- **User authentication** – Secure login system with encrypted passwords
- **Input validation** – Prevents SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- **Session management** – Ensures secure access control and prevents unauthorized logins
- **Data encryption** – Secure storage of sensitive student and user data

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with cloud storage for backup and scalability
- Mobile application version for enhanced accessibility
- API support for integration with third-party applications
- AI-based analytics for student performance insights
- Multi-language support to cater to diverse user needs
